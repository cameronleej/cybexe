## About Us
cybexe is a web application created by our development team. We have a simulation of cybersecurity principles where you input a type of network, and parameters 
of security and attack levels. The simulation shows how quickly, and forcefully malware can spread in a network and how important cybersecurity is to life on the internet. We want businesses, and regular people to be shown how important being safe on the internet is, and how passwords can be cracked easily. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
