                My Name is Dylan Cunningham, and I am 21 years old living in Morgantown, WV. I am a sophomore at West Virginia University 
                pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science with an area of emphasis in cybersecurity. I'm originally from Newport News, VA,
                and come to WVU in the fall of 2020. I'm a contributor to this project as a part of a final project for my CS 230 class.
                My work on the project was heavily focused on backend engineering and designing the simulation components.
