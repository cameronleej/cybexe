                    Passwords are the key to security of our information in the age of technology, and each day it becomes easier
                and easier to crack them. This is why password security is so important to focus on when doing anything in the digital world."A single device may have multiple users, 
                each with their own password. Passwords are not unlike a lock-and-key system, 
                in which only the right key will enable a person to have access. The difference is that each person has a different key for the same door"(SecureDataRecovery).
            </p>
            <p> 
                    Any simple password that is easy to remember is not safe on the internet anylonger. It used to be that you had to use something memorable,
                and short so that one could easily recall and use on every website they had an account on. Now, passwords without numbers, special characters, or capital letters
                can be cracked in just minutes. Even now, "A seven-character complex password could be cracked in 31 seconds, while one with six or fewer characters could be cracked instantly"
                if someone were to have the correct hardware and knowledge. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-an-8-character-password-could-be-cracked-in-less-than-an-hour/#:~:text=An%2018%2Dcharacter%20password%20with,2%20million%20years%20to%20crack.">
                Tech Republic</a> has a great article showing the mathematical statistics of how quickly someone could brute force crack your password. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    To have a secure password, one must have checked a number of parameters to ensure that it will not be easily obtained. Those being, using special characters,
                using pass-phrases, and longer strings of words or numbers to make it harder for someone to guess, or obtain. Having a set of randomized characters also can help to
                prevent these problems from occuring. A good length of a password be around 8-16 characters, and stored in something like a password manager, or written notebook 
                kept away from any one elses eyes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    In our project, <span style="font-style: italic;">cybexe</span>, we aimed to make it easier for someone to quickly test their passwords for their strength according to numbers found 
                from how easily each character could be guessed. You can input your password, and our application will test it's length, as long with other parameters to give 
                you an idea of how strong it is, and if it should be used or not. Also, we have the ability to randomly generate a password that can be stored somewhere safe, 
                and you can feel comfortable that it will not be cracked easily. Our focus is to show the importance of password security, and to show how being safe on the internet
                is vital to the protection of yourself, and your data.
